/**
  * Based on the Guiding Principles, your test should resemble how users 
  * interact with your code (component, page, etc.) as much as possible. 
  * With this in mind, we recommend this order of priority:

  * Queries Accessible to Everyone queries that reflect the experience 
  * of visual/mouse users as well as those that use assistive technology
  * 
  * **getByLabelText**: Only really good for form fields, but this is the 
  * number one method a user finds those elements, so it should be your top preference.
  * 
  * **getByPlaceholderText**: A placeholder is not a substitute for a label. But if 
  * that's all you have, then it's better than alternatives.
  * 
  * getByText: Not useful for forms, but this is the number 1 method a user 
  * finds other elements (like buttons to click), so it should be your top 
  * preference for non-form elements.
  * 
  * getByDisplayValue: The current value of a form element can be useful when 
  * navigating a page with filled-in values.
  * 
  * Semantic Queries HTML5 and ARIA compliant selectors. Note that the user 
  * experience of interacting with these attributes varies greatly across 
  * browsers and assistive technology.
  * 
  * **getByAltText**: If your element is one which supports alt text (img, area, 
  * and input), then you can use this to find that element.
` *`
  * **getByTitle**: The title attribute is not consistently read by screenreaders, 
  * and is not visible by default for sighted users.
  * 
  * **getByRole**: This can be used to select dialog boxes and other 
  * difficult-to-capture elements in a more semantic way
  * 
  * Test IDs
  * 
  * **getByTestId**: The user cannot see (or hear) these, so this is only 
  * recommended for cases where you can't match by text or it doesn't make 
  * sense (the text is dynamic).
